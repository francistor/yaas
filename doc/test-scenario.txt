If not found, drops packet. 
If found, proxies to Superserver. The legacy_client_id in the database is sent in the response
Class attribute or, if not found, set to "unprovisioned_legacy_client_id"

== Accounting Request
Proxies to Superserver
Writes CDR

== NASReq AA
Proxies to Superserver.
Includes, in the response sent to the client, the Class attribute send by the Superserver

== NASReq AC
Proxies to Superserver
Writes CDR

== Gx
In the default setting, proxies to superserver

= SuperServer algorithm

== Access Request

with the text "The reply message!"

If username contains "drop", drops the request

Otherwise, sends an Access-Accept echoing the User-Password

= Test scenario with Nokia AAA.

To be launched with bin/aaaserver and default parameters. Will launch one instance

== Diameter


Nokia dt						-> Yaas								-> Nokia AAA
	diameter-host = testHost		diameter-host = host1.yaas			diameter-host = 8950AAA
									diameter-realm = yaas				diameter-realm = *
									listening-port = 3868				listening-port = 3869
	

== Radius

Nokia rt						-> Yaas								-> Nokia AAA
									ports = 1812, 1813					ports = 11812
																		ports = 11813
	

	
= Test scenario with yass only

To be launched with "testAll" script. Will start three instances

client									server									superserver
	- diameterHost = client.yaasclient		- diameterHost = server.yaasserver		- diameterHost = superserver.yaassuperserver
	- diameterPort = 3867					- diameterPort = 3868					- diameterPort = 3869
											- RadiusAuth = 1812						- radiusAuth = 11812
											- RadiusAcct = 1813						- radiusAcct = 11813
											
										Handler makes database query				Hosts session server and client database (ignite)
